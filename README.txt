Minecraft internally tracks who should be credited with killing someone if they die. This plugin
uses that to check if a player logged out while being attacked, and kills them if they did.

This plugin is intended for those that want a super lightweight and minimal way to prevent combat
logging. If you need configurability, a more heavy plugin may suit you better.
